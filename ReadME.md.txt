# Neural Style Transfer README

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for Neural Style Transfer using a VGG19-based model. The following instructions guide you through setting up and running the notebook.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

You can install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install matplotlib Pillow
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/style-transfer.git
cd style-transfer
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the `neural_style_transfer.ipynb` notebook from the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

4. Run the notebook cell by cell, following the instructions provided within the notebook. Be sure to modify the paths and hyperparameters according to your specific setup.

## Additional Notes

- **Dataset:** If you want to train the model on a custom dataset, make sure to replace the paths and adapt the data loading section in the notebook accordingly.

- **Styling:** Adjust the style image path, content image path, and other hyperparameters to experiment with different stylizations.

- **Output:** The stylized images will be saved in the specified `saved_dir_path`.
