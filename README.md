# Style Transfer
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for Neural Style Transfer using a VGG19-based model. The following instructions guide you through setting up and running the notebook.

Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

+ Python 3.x
+ Jupyter Notebook
+ PyTorch
+ Matplotlib
+ PIL (Pillow)
  
You can install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install matplotlib Pillow
```
To run the notebook on your workspace simply download the Python notebook to your workspace(you can upload the notebook to Google Colab for GPU speed up if needed). Run the notebook cell by cell and the code should work. Make sure you have style.jpg and content.jpg in the same folder as you are running the notebook from. You can also change the style and content according to your wish but keep the names same or you can change that in the Hyperparameters section in the notebook.
